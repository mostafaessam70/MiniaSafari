  <h1>Luxor</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Luxor</h2>
     <p class="info">Luxor is often called the worldâ€™s greatest open-air museum, but that comes nowhere near describing this extraordinary place. Nothing in the world compares to the scale and grandeur of the monuments that have survived from ancient Thebes. </p>

    Luxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the great capital of (Upper) Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the glorious city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the Ancient Egyptian texts as (approximate pronunciation: "Waset"), which meant "city of the sceptre" (conventionally pronounced as "ta ipet" and meaning "the shrine") and then, in a later period, the Greeks called it Thebai and the Romans after them Thebae. Thebes was also known as "the city of the 100 gates", sometimes being called "southern Heliopolis" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as niw.t, which simply means "city", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis).Montuhotep II who united Egypt after the troubles of the first intermediate period brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale.

The temple complex is laid out on three terraces rising from the plain, linked by ramps, which divide it into a northern and a southern half.

Early risers are definitely rewarded here, as many of the sights open at 6am. For great aerial views over the entire west bank, with its temples and village farmland tucked between the escarpment, take a hot air balloon ride, the town's most popular activity, with balloons all taking off just after sunrise</p>

        Sohag is one of the major Coptic Christian areas of Upper Egypt. Although there are few sights in the city, the nearby White and Red Monasteries are well worth a visit, and the town of Akhmim, across the river, is of interest.

     It is one of the governorates of Upper Egypt which has a deep-rooted history and heritage which extends to the ancient ages, where Abydos, now located in Markaz Belina, was the capital of Egypt all through the eras of the first four Pharaonic Dynasties. Also, the ancient city of This (Thinis) or El-Tina, the village of mud or clay just north of Abydos, was home and headquarters of the first Pharaoh of Egypt, known in history as Mina Narmer who managed to unify Egypt.
     During the Islamic era, the whole area of the governorate had been a part of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire until it became a separate province called Upper Egypt or Girga and its capital was Girga city. Later, with the rule of Muhammad Ali, Egypt was divided into directorates. However, Girga Directorate kept its name until 1960, when the capital was moved to Sohag and the name of the governorate changed accordingly.

           During the 6th dynasty, the powerful nomarchs of the 12th nome of Upper Egypt were buried in rock-cut tombs near Deir El Gabrawi. Some of these nomarchs held the title Great Overloard of the Abydene Nome, and so controlled a large area extending from the 8th nome (Abydos) to the 13th nome of Upper Egypt. It is remarkable that some scenes in the tomb of one of these nomarchs, Ibi, occur again in the Theban tomb (TT36) of a man of the same name from the reign of Psammetichus I, about 1600 years later.

              The finds from El Badari form the original basis for the Badarian culture (c. 5500-4000 BC), the earliest phase of the Upper Egyptian Predynastic period. The area stretches for 30 km along the east bank of the Nile, and was first excavated by Guy Brunton and Gertrude Caton-Thompson between 1922 and 1931. Most of the cemeteries in the Badarian region have yielded distinctive pottery vessels (particularly red-polished ware with blackened tops), as well as terracotta and ivory anthropomorphic figures, slate palettes, stone vases and flint tools.

The dam impounds the floodwaters, releasing them when needed to maximize their utility on irrigated land, to water hundreds of thousands of new acres, to improve navigation both above and below Asw?n, and to generate enormous amounts of electric power (the damâ€™s 12 turbines can generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours annually). The reservoir, which has a depth of 300 feet (90 metres) and averages 14 miles (22 km) in width, supports a fishing industry.</p>

     Minya became a minor power center and it continued to hold sway over the center of Egypt through the Middle Kingdom.
     Visiting Al Minya is not a common stop on most tours. The sites are visited much less frequently and the atmosphere of the town is not geared toward foreign visitors. While the town doesnâ€™t offer much to visitors, there are some interested colonial era buildings in the old section of town near the central midan, Tahrir Square.
     The tombs of Beni Hassan, cut into the rocky cliffs on the east side of the Nile, date from the period of Al Minyaâ€™s influence. There are 39 tombs in all, but only the four most impressive are open to the public.

      Founded in 331 BC by 25-year-old Alexander the Great, Alexandria (Al Iskendariyya) is the stuff of legend. Its towering Pharos lighthouse, marking the ancient harbour's entrance, was one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and its Great Library was considered the archive of ancient knowledge. Alas, fate dealt the city a spate of cruel blows. The Pharos collapsed and the Great Library was torched. Part of the ancient city disappeared under the sea and part under the modern city, so there are few visible remains of the glorious past.

This is the most important site in the world for the demonstration of this stage of evolution. It portrays vividly the form and life of these whales during their transition.

    <h2>Welcome to Port Said</h2>
    <p class="info">
      In its late-19th-century raffish heyday, Port Said was Egyptâ€™s city of vice and sin. The boozing seafarers and packed brothels may have long since been scrubbed away, but this louche period is evoked still in the waterfrontâ€™s muddle of once-grand architecture slowly going to seed.

    attraction, and the reason for the townâ€™s establishment, is the Suez Canal. The raised pedestrian-only boardwalk running along the waterfront provides up-close views over the canalâ€™s northern entry point, allowing travellers to admire the passing supertanker traffic up close. The free ferry that crosses the canal to the languid suburb of Port Fuad is the only opportunity for casual visitors to ride the waters of this marvel of construction.

      Sharm El Sheikh was little more than an occasional base of operations for local fishermen; the nearest permanent settlement was in Nabk, north of Ras El Nasrani ("The Tiran Straits"). Commercial development of the area began when the Israelis built the town of Ofira, overlooking Sharm El Maya Bay and the Nesima area, and opened the first tourist-oriented establishments in the area 6 km north at Naama Bay. These included a marina hotel on the southern side of the bay, a nature field school on the northern side, diving clubs, a now well-known promenade, and the Naama Bay Hotel. The site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.
